Hello,
Using Html,CSS and SCSS I have built a website for a Resort.I have created 4 html pages for this site.

page main :
__________
 is the home page of this website.Using Bootstrap I created a nav bar. Which will direct you from one page to the next.I have used stylesheet on this main page which includes css properties to assign the color and float ,width and padding to help with aligning the images.a "box class" has also been utilised on this page. The @media query will change the color of the screen to yellow from powder blue and also shorten the the name ofthe resort to just "Nature Resort " from "Welcome to Nature Resort" when the creen size goes belo 599px .css selectors that would change the color of the link when the cursor hovers or is clicked has also been used. the href attribute will redirect you to the contact page.

page1: 
________
This is the Amenities page of the resort . I addition to most of the features used in the main page , I have  used both an ordered and unordered list as well as an id selector. The message on top of the page that says go straight to amenities will skip all the images and go straight to amenities which has been does with the help of the id selector.Here i have used SCSS variable ,nesting and inheritance in the stylesheet.

page2:
_______
This is the page showing the Rooms of the hotel. I have used a striped tabel in this page
to show the differnt kids of rooms available.

page3:
_________
This is the final page of the website. This is the contact page. I have used 2 Bootstrap columns using the grid model. One displays the contact information and the other displays some warning messages.
